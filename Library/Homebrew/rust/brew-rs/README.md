# brew-rs

`brew-rs` is the opt-in Rust frontend for a small set of `brew` commands.
Today the gated command set is `search`, `info`, `list`, `install`,
`reinstall`, `update`, `upgrade`, and `uninstall`.

Meaningful Rust behavior currently exists for `search` and `list`.
`info` and the mutating commands currently print a warning to `stderr` and
delegate back to the existing Ruby frontend for correctness.

It is intentionally built through `brew vendor-install brew-rs`, which runs
standard Cargo commands under the hood instead of a bespoke build wrapper.

## Pre-step

Export both Rust frontend gate variables before building or running `brew-rs`:

```bash
export HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER=1
export HOMEBREW_EXPERIMENTAL_RUST_FRONTEND=1
```

From the repository root, before running `rake`, add Homebrew's portable Ruby to
`PATH`:

```bash
portable_ruby_bindir="$PWD/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/current/bin"
[[ -x "${portable_ruby_bindir}/ruby" ]] || ./bin/brew vendor-install ruby
export PATH="${portable_ruby_bindir}:${PATH}"
```

## Build

From the repository root:

```bash
./bin/brew vendor-install brew-rs
```

## Enable

```bash
./bin/brew search jq
```

The first supported Rust-backed command will run `brew vendor-install brew-rs`
automatically and skip rebuilding when the vendored binary is already up-to-date.
If `cargo` from the `rust` formula is not available yet, `brew` prints a warning
to `stderr` and falls back to the existing Ruby frontend instead of failing.
When `brew-rs` is used, `brew` prints an experimental warning to `stderr`.
If a command is not meaningfully implemented in Rust yet, `brew-rs` also
prints a handoff warning before delegating back to Ruby.

## Rust Checks

```bash
cd Library/Homebrew/rust/brew-rs
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
```

## Homebrew Checks

```bash
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 ./bin/brew typecheck
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 ./bin/brew lgtm
```

The Rust frontend tests now live in the `brew-rs` crate and the dedicated
`brew-rs` GitHub Actions workflow instead of `brew tests`.

## Benchmark

The `benchmark` task compares the Ruby and Rust frontends with `hyperfine` for
the commands currently gated through `brew-rs`.

`rake` should be run with Homebrew's portable Ruby bin directory at the front
of `PATH`. The benchmark prints the normal `hyperfine` output along with each
command's stdout/stderr. Right now it only benchmarks commands with meaningful
Rust implementations: `search` and `list <installed formula>`.

It prefers the workflow-installed `rust` formula for the `list` benchmark and
falls back to the first installed formula if `rust` is unavailable. If the
vendored binary is missing, the benchmark task builds it first with
`vendor-install`.

```bash
brew install hyperfine
cd Library/Homebrew/rust/brew-rs
rake benchmark
```

## Tier 1 Smoke Test

Run these on a default-prefix Tier 1 Homebrew install outside this repository checkout:

```bash
brew install hello
brew reinstall hello
brew upgrade hello
brew uninstall hello
brew update --quiet --force
```

Current install smoke test:
`aview` was the real dependency-bearing formula used to validate the
current Rust install path because its `aalib` dependency stays inside the
supported bottle-only slice. `libaacs` still delegates back to Ruby
because it has `build_dependencies`, `uses_from_macos`, `post_install`,
and a `:any` bottle that still needs relocation support. I did not find a
current real formula with a `>=2` dependency tree that also stays inside
the current Rust install boundary, so `aview` is the closest real-world
smoke test for now. In this environment I had to prime the cache with
Ruby `brew fetch aalib aview` first because Ruby could fetch those GHCR
bottles while the Rust downloader still failed against GHCR.

## Next Steps

The current plan is to keep correctness-sensitive install lifecycle work in
Ruby while moving the heavy bottle path into Rust in small slices.

- Keep `brew.sh` as a thin gate and dispatch layer.
- Keep using existing Homebrew paths, caches, and metadata formats.
- Move more read-only behavior into Rust when it produces clear wins.
- For formula installs, move bottle fetch and pour into Rust first.
- Keep `post_install` and the more involved finish/finalization steps in Ruby
  until narrower shared helpers exist and profiling shows a clear benefit to
  moving more of that logic.
