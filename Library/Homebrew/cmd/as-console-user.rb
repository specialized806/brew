          `as-console-user` <command> [<args> ...]

          Run a Homebrew command as the active macOS console user.

          This is intended for MDM, Munki and Jamf workflows where `brew` is
          invoked as root but Homebrew operations should run as the logged-in
          console user. Uses their home and a clean environment, dispatching
          through `HOMEBREW_BREW_FILE`.
          When `sudo` is disabled or unavailable, root can switch users directly.
