# Taps (Third-Party Repositories)

The `brew tap` command adds repositories that Homebrew can use for formulae, casks and external commands.
The one-argument form assumes a repository on GitHub, while the two-argument form accepts any URL supported by Git.

Code in a tap can run with your user's privileges.
Read [Tap Trust](Tap-Trust.md) before using a non-official tap.

## The `brew tap` command

`brew tap` without arguments lists the currently tapped repositories.
It prints nothing when no taps are installed.

```console
$ brew tap
petere/postgresql
```

`brew tap <user>/<repository>` clones `https://github.com/<user>/homebrew-<repository>` into Homebrew's tap directory.
Homebrew updates the repository during `brew update`.

Tapping a repository does not grant whole-tap trust.
Install a fully qualified item to trust only that item, or use `brew trust` before accessing an item by its short name:

```sh
brew tap user/repository
brew install user/repository/formula

brew trust --formula user/repository/formula
brew install formula
```

See [Tap Trust](Tap-Trust.md#installing-from-a-tap) for formula, cask, command and whole-tap trust options.

`brew tap <user>/<repository> <URL>` clones a repository from the specified Git URL without assuming GitHub or a particular transport.

`brew tap --repair` adds missing tap manpage and shell-completion symlinks.
It also corrects remote references for taps whose upstream default branch has been renamed.

`brew untap <user>/<repository> [...]` removes one or more taps.
Homebrew deletes the local repositories and no longer loads their contents.

## Repository naming conventions

On GitHub, a repository must be named `homebrew-<repository>` to use the one-argument form of `brew tap`.
The `homebrew-` prefix can be omitted from the command:

```sh
brew tap username/foobar
```

This command maps to `https://github.com/username/homebrew-foobar`.
The two-argument form does not impose this naming convention because the full URL is explicit.

## Duplicate names

A tap may contain a formula with the same name as one in `homebrew/core`.
Use the fully qualified name to select the formula from a particular tap:

```sh
brew install vim
brew install username/repository/vim
```

The first command installs `vim` from `homebrew/core`.
The second installs the formula from `username/repository` and trusts that individual formula.

Give customised formulae distinct names when users should be able to select them without qualification.
Dependencies of `homebrew/core` formulae cannot be replaced with formulae from other taps.
